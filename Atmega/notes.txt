So far:
Downloaded atmel studio and tried to get "hello world" type of program to run on Xplained Mini, and Xplained pro. Did not get either to even get onto the board. Need to figure out if we should use avr-dude rather than atmel studio(windows only)

//More stuff
In order to switch to C we would use the AVR compiler
